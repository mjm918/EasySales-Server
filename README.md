# EasySales-Server

Started this side project to solve some ongoing issues on easysales server.

Aim to solve:

1. Real time data stream
2. An isolated object store database with the ability of memory caching. I named it `moedb`
after my cat's name 
3. Isolated HTTP and TCP server
4. TODO: Load balancer
5. Those who know about my search engine `scout`, i'm going to launch `v2` of `scout` together with this project

------

My main focus in on `moedb`. My plan is to make this similar to firebase rt database.

This repo will remain as public until i start adding business logics in the code. ✌️
